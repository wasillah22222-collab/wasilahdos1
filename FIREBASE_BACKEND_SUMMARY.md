## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables Required
```env
# Firebase Configuration (from Firebase Console)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket

- ✅ Firestore Database
- ✅ Cloud Storage
- ⚠️ Cloud Functions (future enhancement)
- ⚠️ Cloud Messaging (future enhancement)

## 📈 Required Indexes

Composite indexes needed for optimal performance:

1. **project_submissions**
   - `submittedBy` (Ascending) + `submittedAt` (Descending)
   - `status` (Ascending) + `submittedAt` (Descending)

2. **event_submissions**
   - `submittedBy` (Ascending) + `submittedAt` (Descending)
   - `status` (Ascending) + `submittedAt` (Descending)

3. **programs**
   - `active` (Ascending) + `order` (Ascending)

4. **leaders**
   - `active` (Ascending) + `order` (Ascending)

## ✅ Testing Checklist

## 🚨 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Permission Denied
**Solution:** Check Firestore rules are deployed and user is authenticated

### Issue: Index Required
**Solution:** Click the link in the error message to create the index in Firebase Console

### Issue: Image Upload Fails
**Solution:** Verify file is under 5MB and is an image type

### Issue: Real-time Updates Not Working
**Solution:** Check that listeners are set up correctly and not unsubscribed prematurely

## 📱 Mobile Considerations

- Firebase SDK works on web, iOS, and Android
- Real-time synchronization works across all platforms
- Offline support available with Firestore
- Storage uploads work on all platforms

## 💰 Cost Optimization

### Free Tier Limits (Spark Plan)
- **Firestore:** 50,000 reads, 20,000 writes, 20,000 deletes per day
- **Storage:** 5 GB stored, 1 GB downloaded per day
- **Authentication:** Unlimited

### Tips to Stay Within Free Tier
1. Implement pagination for lists
2. Cache data locally when possible
3. Use real-time listeners efficiently
4. Optimize image sizes before upload
5. Clean up unused storage files
6. Monitor usage in Firebase Console

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Cloud Functions for automated tasks
